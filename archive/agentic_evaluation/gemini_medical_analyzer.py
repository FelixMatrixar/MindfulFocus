Please provide a detailed medical assessment that:

1. **Visual Assessment**: Describe any visible asymmetry you observe in the face
2. **Data Correlation**: Correlate your visual observations with the provided numerical metrics
3. **Regional Analysis**: Identify which facial regions (upper, middle, lower) show the most significant asymmetry
4. **Clinical Considerations**: Suggest possible medical conditions based on the asymmetry pattern
5. **Severity Rating**: Rate the overall asymmetry severity on a scale of 0-10 (0 = perfectly symmetric, 10 = severe asymmetry)
6. **Recommendations**: Provide appropriate medical recommendations

Focus on medical accuracy and be specific about anatomical landmarks and measurements. Consider the symmetry score, EAR differences, and head pose when making your assessment."""

2. **Visible Patterns**: Note any patterns, spots, rings, or discoloration
3. **Pupil Assessment**: Evaluate pupil size, shape, and symmetry between both eyes
4. **Medical Signs**: Look for signs of:
   - Corneal arcus (whitish ring around iris)
   - Kayser-Fleischer rings (copper deposits)
   - Heterochromia (color differences)
   - Iris nevus or other pigmented lesions
   - Wilson's disease indicators
